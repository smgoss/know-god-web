## Development

### Getting Started

First, make sure that you have a suitable version of Node.js. This project uses node v20.17.0. To check your node version, run `node --version`. If you don't have node v20.17.0 installed or a suitable version, the recommended way to install it is with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), a development tool version manager.

You will also need to ensure you are using yarn version `4.7.0`.

```bash
# Install asdf and the node plugin
brew install asdf
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git

# Integrate it with your shell
# ZSH shell integration is shown here, but for installation instructions for other shells, go to https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_3-install-asdf
echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc

# IMPORTANT: Close that terminal tab/window and open another one to apply the changes to your shell configuration file

# Install the version of node defined in this project's .tool-versions file
asdf install nodejs

# Check that the node version is now 20.17.0
node --version
```

#### Install & Run

Once you're on the correct node version, install the dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

Run `start:dev` if you want to grab data from the staging DB.

Open [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200) with your browser to view the site.
